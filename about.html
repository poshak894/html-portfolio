<h1>About Me</h1><hr/>
<p>
  I'm Poshak Khetan, currently pursuing engineering in India. Ever since I can remember, I've been a curious soul, always wanting to understand how things work and how they can be made better.

<h2>My Motivation and Hobbies : </h2>
<p>
  I love tackling challenges, whether it's cracking a tough algorithm, designing something sustainable, or brainstorming with my peers. Each new problem is an opportunity to learn and grow, and that keeps me motivated every single day.
  When I'm not buried in textbooks or coding away, I like to unwind by exploring new places and capturing moments through photography. I am great at playing badminton and I'm also interested in Robotics so sometimes I do brainstorming on that too. Plus, I'm an avid reader, always looking for stories that can broaden my perspective and spark new ideas.
